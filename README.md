# csv_reader_project

For my final assignment in basic C programming course I chose CSV Reader as my final project.
Description:

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a common way to store tabular data, making them a 
valuable format for data interchange between applicaDons. Write a program that reads house 
temperature data from a CSV-file and prints a horizontal bar graph of the temperature in the selected 
room. The CSV file starts with a header row and then conDnues with lines of comma separated data. 
The header row contains two Dtles: Room and Temperature. Data lines contain room name and the 
temperature separated by commas.
Program must ask user to select a room and then print the temperatures with one decimal precision 
followed with a bar graph using dashes (-). Each dash corresponds to 0.5 cenDgrade and 
temperatures in the range of 0 – 30 are printed as horizontal bars. Temperatures that are outside or 
the range are printed as a single X on the lee. If the selected room does not exist, then program must 
print an error message. Program must detect number of rooms and their names from the CSV file, 
there may not any fixed room names
